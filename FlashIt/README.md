Math Smilies
===========

This is a JavaScript game for practicing addition and subtraction. 
The problems are aimed at first graders trying to improve their speed. 

At first the game was called FlashIT for flash cards. Images of smilies are given as a reward for solving problems. My 7 year old daughter convinced me that it's all about the smilies and renamed the project to Math Smilies. 
After refreshing the page and seeing the expression on my daughter's face when all her smilies were gone I realized that I had to add persistence. Local storage is used to store the number of smilies earned. They continue to accumulate in the smiley bank.
